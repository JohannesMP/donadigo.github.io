                        Movable Blocks is a plugin for Openplanet that allows you to introduce
                        movement into your TrackMania maps.

                        With Movable Blocks you can:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create "<b>movables</b>" which are simple scripts that define how a block will move on the map</li>
                            <li>Control the state of these movables through MediaTracker clips</li>
                            <li>Share the maps that use movable blocks and have them played by other people (the Movable Blocks script is required)</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3 class="subtitle"><b>How to use?</b></h3>
                    <p class="content">
                       First, go to the TrackMania editor and create a new track. Press "F3" to show the Openplanet top menu.
                       <b>There now should be a new window called "Movable Blocks" visible.</b>
                       If the window doesn't show make sure that you installed the plugin correctly and that
                       the "Movable Blocks" checkbox in Openplanet -> Settings -> Plugins is checked.

                       Below is a video illustrating creating a simple track with movable blocks:<br><br>

                            <li>toggle <code>movable id</code>: toggles the movable, making it enabled when it is disabled and vice versa</li>
                            <li>reset <code>movable id</code>: resets the movable to it's initial state, disabling it if it's enabled</li>

                        <p>This release contains important fixes to the gameplay:</p>
                        <ul class="desc-ul">
                            <li>
                                Fixed block speed movement based on current FPS of the game.
                                <i>Keep in mind that physics are still not deterministic, differnent runs will have different results.</i>
                            </li>
                            <li>Fixed performance issues when playing on a large map with the plugin enabled.
                                The game should not lag anymore when playing on maps without movable blocks at all.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Fixed that <code>reset</code> commands would reset block's position but would not update their collision.
                            </li>
                            <li>The plugin now properly shuts down after disabling it in the menu.</li>
                            <li>The DLL can now be extracted into <code>Scripts</code> or <code>Openplanet4</code>.</li>
                        </ul>

                <section id="faq">
                    <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h3>
                    <div class="content">
                        <b>Q: The plugin does not work! What do?</b><br>
                        <b>A:</b> If for some reason the plugin does not work after installing it make sure that:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <code>MovableBlocks.dll</code> file is located within <code>C:\Users\Username\Openplanet4\</code></li>
                            <li>The <code>MovableBlocks</code> folder is located within <code>C:\Users\Username\Openplanet4\Scripts</code></li>
                        </ul><br>

                        <b>Q: Can I host maps with movable blocks on a server?</b><br>
                        <b>A:</b> Yes, you can, but remember that players on the server have to have Openplanet with the script
                        installed in order to have the blocks move on the map. Otherwise, they still can join and play but the blocks
                        will not move.<br><br>

                        <b>Q: Will Press Forward maps with movable blocks work?</b><br>
                        <b>A:</b> Likely not. Even though the plugin tries hard to provide same movement everytime you play,
                        it does not hook into the game's loop so it's not "consistent"
                        for the game's physics. This is a limitation that cannot be worked around for now.
