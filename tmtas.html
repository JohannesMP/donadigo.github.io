                <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Introduction</b></h3>
                <p class="content">
                    There has been recently quite some interest in performing scripted runs for TrackMania using
                    external tools and for a
                    reason. This interest was induced by certain controversial events and by the fact that some people
                    actually started
                    developing such tools for the game. Let's uncover some details about TrackMania TAS'ing and also
                    some related topics.
                    This post will be a little Q&A for people who are interested. <b>I will not talk about technical
                        details here,
                        these are deliberately left out.</b>
                </p>

                <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Q: What is TAS?</b></h3>
                <p class="content">
                    <b>A:</b> TAS stands for Tool-Assisted Speedrun and it is basically creating a set of inputs that
                    will be performed to achieve
                    a certain goal within the game. Many games that have speedrunning communities also have TAS’es made
                    for them. These runs
                    are often clearly distinguishable and have separate leaderboards to not clutter „real” record
                    leaderboards for humans.

                    Since TrackMania is a highly competetive game and there’s always been interest for improving current
                    world records,
                    people started to develop tools to improve times.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Q: How does TAS work for TrackMania?</b></h3>
                <p class="content">
                    <b>A:</b> Most tools developed rely on creating a script with specific inputs that will be replayed
                    at the run time. This is
                    also the case for other games, but with the exception that these games are ran in an emulator –
                    which means they have
                    100% reproducibility. Because TrackMania isn’t an „old” game and doesn’t run in the emulator – it is
                    much harder to
                    create such a script because of so-called desyncs. Basically, the script won’t always produce the
                    same output. These
                    desyncs come from the fact (over-simplification) that modern OS’es like Windows don’t run processes
                    in „real-time”.
                    However, it is possible to reduce the impact of these desyncs – but I won’t go into detail.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>An example of a script can be:</i><br>
                    <code>
                        0ms press up<br>
                        1200ms press left<br>
                        2440ms release left<br>
                        4000ms press right<br>
                        5500ms release right<br>
                        6720ms press down<br>
                    </code><br>

                    You can also slow down the game time, but this is rather just a helper to get the scripted inputs
                    right.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Q: Is it hard to create a good TAS run?</b></h3>
                <p class="content">
                    <b>A:</b> Absolutely. TrackMania is one of these games that for 1 second ingame you need to spend
                    hours to get that 1 second
                    done even decently. This is due to the unbelievable complexity of the game and it’s mechanics. For
                    each input change,
                    you need to make sure that the car stays on the track and also has an optimal line. To do that, you
                    need to restart the
                    run, wait for the script to execute all inputs and then see the outcome for yourself. The longer the
                    track is, the
                    longer the process becomes. Plus, many tracks (especially Nadeo) have really good world record times
                    already (one could
                    say that they’re close to being maxed). These are the hardest to beat even for carefully prepared
                    inputs but are by far
                    the most popular tracks to TAS.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Q: Is it possible to distinguish between a TAS run and a run done by a
                        human?</b></h3>
                <p class="content">
                    <b>A:</b> Currently, <i>no</i>. There’s actually no solid characteristic that makes TAS and human
                    runs distinguishable from each
                    other. Even seeing the replay ingame will not give you an idea if it’s indeed a human that drove
                    this run. This problem
                    has prevented people who developed these tools to release them to the public due to an obvious flaw:
                    world record
                    leaderboards could be polluted with TAS runs without clousure. This is the biggest problem with
                    TAS’ing TrackMania that
                    has been unsolved and won’t likely be solved ever.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Q: Were there cases where these records appeared on TMX?</b></h3>
                <p class="content">
                    <b>A:</b> Yes, notably <a target="blank"
                        href="https://tmnforever.tm-exchange.com/main.aspx?action=trackshow&id=2242#auto">A04</a>,
                    <a target="blank" href="https://tmnforever.tm-exchange.com/main.aspx?action=trackshow&id=2309#auto">B10</a> and

                    had uploaded TAS’ed replays without any
                    closure from their authors, both of which were removed after people started investigating and proved
                    that these replays
                    were indeed scripted.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Q: Where can I watch some of these runs?</b></h3>
                <p class="content">
                    <b>A:</b> These two YouTube channels uploaded some of runs that were tool-assisted:<br>
                    <a target="blank"
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TmSpeedy0407">https://www.youtube.com/user/TmSpeedy0407</a><br>

                    There are currently no one else uploading such runs to my knowledge.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Q: Are these tools available for download?</b></h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 80px;">
                    <b>A:</b> No, nobody including me released these tools to the public simply to keep the integrity of
                    the leaderboards and to
                    keep up the competetivness of the game. Could these be published in the future? Maybe, but I believe
                    this is mostly
                    about a community agreement and not about trying to prevent people from misusing these
                    tools.<br><br>

                    I think that at least for now, this is a good thing. People who have access to these tools
                    explicitly do
                    not upload fake records to TMX, instead a YouTube video is made to showcase the replay. This ensures
                    that both parties are happy.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 30px; color: #c4570f;"><i>And now onto some other random but related
                        questions.</i></p>
                <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Q: Is TrackMania „random”?</b></h3>
                <p class="content">
                    <b>A:</b> No, TrackMania physics are completely 100% deterministic. That means that the same set of
                    inputs will always yield
                    the same outcome in the game. For us, humans, certain behaviour of the car can be „random”
                    because it is not
                    directly related to the inputs and doesn't make sense, but that doesn’t mean that the underlying
                    physics are based on
                    any random factor. There just isn't one.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Q: Can you create an AI to drive tracks perfectly?</b></h3>
                <p class="content">
                    <b>A:</b> To my knowledge there have been a few people that tried to create a neural network that
                    would drive a track, but the
                    keyword in the question here is <i>perfectly</i>. These networks could in theory drive a track but
                    nothing more than that.
                    These runs would be really basic and totatlly not what you would see from today’s world records. I
                    haven’t seen any real
                    results on driving tracks by an AI algorithm to this day.<br><br>

                    <i>There is really no „perfect” run existing in TrackMania</i> (except for a few one-turn tracks).
                </p>
                <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Q: What about <i>maxed</i> records?</b></h3>
                <p class="content">
                    <b>A:</b> Besides a few tracks from the TMN ESWC campaign like A-0, there are no <i>maxed</i>
                    records existing in TrackMania. What can
                    look like a perfect run can be only closer or an approximation to a hypothetical real perfect time.
                    Improving this time
                    only brings us closer to that unknown limit. Of course, there can also be a <i>human limit</i> which
                    most people really mean
                    when they’re talking about a maxed record. This limit can be somewhat approximated based on a
                    collection of world
                    records previously set by drivers. By combining the best parts of these runs we can roughly say what
                    would be the limit
                    with <i>current strategies</i>.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Q: Can you write a script to discover a maxed record?</b></h3>
                <p class="content">
                    <b>A:</b> It’s possible to write a program to take some existing inputs and change them randomly to
                    discover new runs but even
                    that is hard enough. Searching for a real possible maxed record is completely unfeasible and
                    impossible to do right now
                    even on really short tracks. To really know the optimal time of a track, you would have to try out
                    <i>every possible input
                        combination</i>. It’s much more feasible to take an existing record and change random inputs in
                    it to come up with a new combination that
                    maybe faster than the original record.<br><br>

                    <i>But let’s just imagine that we want to find out a "maxed" record on the simplest Nadeo track with
                        one turn: A-0. Let's see how much combinations it would take to brute force it.
                        The current world record is 04.39.</i><br><br>

                    TrackMania checks for input every 10 milliseconds. Suppose we can only do keyboard inputs.
                    That’s 4390ms / 10 = 439 possible slots in which we can press / release keys. So every 10
                    milliseconds we can change
                    what keys are pressed.<br><br>

                    At each slot we can have 16 possible input combinations since there are 4 keys you can press: up,
                    down, left, right (2^4
                    = 16). You can press e.g: left, up and down exactly at the same time.<br><br>

                    That’s 16^439 possible input cominations on this track. Given that this number far exceeds a 64 bit
                    unsigned integer I
                    won’t try to determine how much time it would take to go through all of these combinations. That’s
                    on a track that is 4
                    seconds long. Now, most of these combinations would be completely nonsensical but they are still
                    valid. <b>You must admit though
                        that this is pretty useless, but it shows how complex the TrackMania environment really is.</b>
