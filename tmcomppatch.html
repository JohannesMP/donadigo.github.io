                    <p class="content">
                        TrackMania Competition Patch is a special patch for the game that does not allow
                        means of cheating such as using macros, slowing down the game and other
                        forms of injecting inputs. The patch is in a beta phase, which means there could be 
                        bugs or crashes while playing the game.
                    </p>

                <section id="why">
                    <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Why is there a need for this patch?</b></h3>
                    <p class="content">
                        The patch is meant to solidify & validate records uploaded on important TMX categories
                        such as Official Campaigns and Classic tracks. With the increasing interest in TAS'ing
                        the game, the patch is a leeway into ensuring the leaderboards will stay clean for 
                        the forseeable future. None of this has been yet established as a rule in TMX itself,
                        but we're discussing the possibilites of having support implemented for this patch
                        and rules changed in replay uploading (only for important categories that is).

                <section id="how">
                    <h3 class="subtitle"><b>How does it work?</b></h3>
                    <p class="content">
                        The patch is simply installed into the game's installation directory and from
                        there, the patch will always work when you open the game. Under the hood, the patch
                        overrides the input system of TrackMania so that it can verify that all inputs
                        come from a real hardware device. The patch is in no way invasive - it <b>does not</b>
                        install any low level drivers on your system or collect any data about it.

                <section id="distinguish">
                    <h3 class="subtitle"><b>How do I tell I'm running the game with the patch?</b></h3>
                    <p class="content">
                        For now the only real way to see, is to check the title of the game's window.
                        If the game is fullscreen, switch to windowed mode and a (Competition Patch) should be visible in the title of the window.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section id="test">
                    <h3 class="subtitle"><b>What should I test?</b></h3>
                    <p class="content">
                        The game should feel just like vanilla in this regard, but the patch adds a new functionality for replay validation.
                        If you've drove a run with the patch, save the replay, edit it and click on the validate button.
                        If you didn't use any tools or macros, the result should say <b style="color: #00FF00;">Competition Match</b> after validating.
                        If the result is otherwise, but you still didn't use any tools - then that is a bug in the patch.
                        If the text doesn't show, make sure you are using English language ingame. Replays with different input devices such as gamepad, joystick are appreciated.

                    <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Other features</b></h3>
                    <p class="content">
                        Besides verifying that your replays are valid, the patch also enables you to save replays longer than 2 hours,
                        which is not the case in vanilla game. It also diables restarting the race after clicking on opponents in
                        top left corner, preventing from accidental resets.

                        This is not a patch in it's final form, bugs or crashes are expected when running this version - you can use it
                        for serious play, however be ready that it might result in a crash or a bug in the patch that makes your replay mismatch.
                        The game should behave just like without it, even though there may be some subtle differences.

                        <li>2. Unpack all files to the navigated location. All 4 DLL's should now be extracted in the game's install directory.</li>

                    <p class="content">
                        If you want to uninstall the patch, simply navigate to the game directory again and rename dinput8.dll to anything other than that and the patch should stop working. 
                        Deleting files you've unpacked before should also do the job.
