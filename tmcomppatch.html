                        TrackMania Competition Patch is a special patch for the game that does not allow
                        means of cheating such as using macros, slowing down the game and other
                        forms of injecting inputs.

                    <h3 class="subtitle"><b>Why is there a need for this patch?</b></h3>
                    <p class="content">
                        The patch is meant to solidify & validate records uploaded on important TMX categories
                        such as Official Campaigns and Classic tracks. With the increasing interest in TAS'ing
                        the game, the patch is a leeway into ensuring the leaderboards will stay clean for 
                        the forseeable future. Support for this patch is currently being implemented to TMX.

                    <h3 class="subtitle"><b>How does it work?</b></h3>
                    <p class="content">
                        The patch is simply installed into the game's installation directory and from
                        there, the patch will always work when you open the game. Under the hood, the patch
                        overrides the input system of TrackMania so that it can verify that all inputs
                        come from a real hardware device. The patch is in no way invasive - it <b>does not</b>
                        install any low level drivers on your system or collect any data about it.

                    <p class="content">
                        To check if you're running the Competition Patch, look at the game's window title.
                        If the game is fullscreen, switch to windowed mode and a (Competition Patch) should be visible in the title of the window.

                        If you want to uninstall the patch, navigate to the game directory and rename dinput8.dll to anything other than that and the patch should stop working. 
                        Deleting dinput8.dll and TMCompPatch.dll should also work.
