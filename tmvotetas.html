                        I'm publishing this post to showcase the tool I have today, commiunicate the advantages and
                        disatvantages it would bring to the community, and ask you to <a href="http://www.strawpoll.me/20395863">vote</a> on whether it should be

                                This tool allows you to create pre-programmed runs for TrackMania,
                                copy other legitimate runs and improve them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This tool is not an "AI" or any program that creates runs itself -
                                however, it exposes an interface to hook into many game's functions
                                which could be used to build one.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>It was never intended for malicious use nor for cheating.</b> There
                                are multiple restrictions in place to ensure that it's not used for that.
                                When launching the game with the tool, you are only allowed to login
                                offline and save replays with a special signature.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It's still software that can be reverse engineered and abused, just like the
                                game. It's not possible to prevent reversing nor to guarantee that it's 100% safe
                                forever.

                                Works only for TMNF and TMUF.

                            Nothing stops anyone from uploading TAS'ed replays to the
                            TMX leaderboards, even though they can be automatically detected
                            when a run was done with the tool.

                            You can copy the inputs of any replay publicly available and
                            pass of someone's run as yours.

                        <li>
                            Possiblity of reversing the tool and using it for malicious cases such
                            as uploading runs to official mode or making replays undetectable.

                        <li>
                            Increased interest after release could lead to people creating their own
                            tool.

                            Could result in an eventual change of rules on how replays should be uploaded & validated.
